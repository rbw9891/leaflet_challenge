Here in lies the leaflet challenge respository for module 15:

## Background

In this assignment we built a leaflet map utilizing D3, Javascript, and HTML. We used data from the USGS to plot earthquake occurences across the globe and their corresponding data. I chose to use the data on earthquakes in the past day which registered higher than 1.0 magnitude. The size of the circle marker relates to the magnitude of the earthquake and the color corresponds to the depth from the surface in km.
